# My Portfolio (Made in React)

Build a personal portfolio webpage utilizing React tools.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a single-page portfolio featuring an header, content section and footer. The content should change without the user being directed to a new page through the use of React components. The project will be deployed on 'gh-pages'.

Other technical criteria for this project include:

- Responsive, polished design
- Header component containing a Navigation component
- Conditional navigation to About Me, Portfolio, Resume/Skills, Contact Me pages
- Portfolio of projects including titles & links
- Project component that is reused multiple times inside the Porfolio component
- Contact form that includes input validations and email regex (form does NOT need to connect to an API or store information)
- Footer providing links to the developer's other online profiles

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Simply visit the website and browse as you please. 

### Expected behavior: 
Site should launch on About Me page with the navigation tab for About Me highlighted. Choosing different options from navigation should conditionally update the highlighted tab and render new content in the body of the document. All project and social links should be active. The resume can be viewed and downloaded. The contact form should have functional input fields and a submit button but will not store/save the data that is entered by the user.
